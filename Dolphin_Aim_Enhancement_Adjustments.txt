Dolphin Aim Enhancement: Adjustments/Fine Tuning

If you have applied the aim enhancements that Prof_GLX and myself have provided at https://github.com/ProfgLX/Sinden-Dolphin-Accuracy-Inis and want to make finishing touches to perfect the aim on your individual system, then follow these steps:


1. Get your Gun setup in Sinden software correctly first.

Make sure you are fully dial-in in the Sinden software first. 
Open the Sinden software and verify on the Alignment tab that your mouse cursor is directly in the middle of the box/arrows. Make adjustments here first. You do not want to be making adjustments to the alignment after fine-tuning your Dolphin/Wii aim. Make sure you are standing in your regular shooting position when making the adjustments.

Still in the Sinden software go to the Configuration tab and check "Show Raw Video", "Show Processed Video" and "Show Rectangle." Stand 		in your normal shooting position, turn on your Sinden border and aim at the screen. In the right hand box you should see a nice blue 		rectangle. Now move the cursor from border to border, all sides of the borders - up, down, left and right. You should get a nice blue 		rectangle through the entire motion. If you get any flicker of the blue rectangle you are losing tracking at some point and will need to 		adjust your standing position, border thickness, brightness/contrast, etc. The Sinden discord is a good place to reach out for help on these 		issues. Once you are sure you are getting a nice, consistant blue border when aiming at all parts of the screen then you are ready to move 		on.

2. Setting up Dolphin
Open the Dolphin emulator. I made all the adjustments on the latest beta release at the time (5.0-13963) but I regularly update. Just don't use an old version. There are newer Dev versions but those are not really meant for game play, more for testing new features, etc. I highly suggest making a Dolphin - Sinden folder and extracting the emulator there. This will keep your Lightgun setup separate from 	your normal Dolphin install. Also, I like to make this Dolphin - Sinden version portable so that all the files you will be working with are 	in this folder vs. a normal install where they are in your user documents folder. This is easy to do, just create a blank text file named "portable.txt" and put it in your Dolphin - Sinden folder. Once you make Dolphin - Sinden portable, close and reopen the emulator. You should now have the configuration folders in the Dolphin - Sinden folder.
The particular folder we are interested in is Dolphin - Sinden/User/Config/Profiles/Wiimote/
This is where your game ini files for each game are located. If you have already applied the Aim Enhancements then you should have ini files 	for the games that we have made adjustments for. If you haven't applied the pack, follow the directions and put all the ini files here now.

3. Making Fine-tune Adjustments in Dolphin
Open the ini file for the game that you would like to fine-tune the aiming. For instance, BBHPRO_P1.ini. You should see this...

[Profile]
Device = DInput/0/Keyboard Mouse
Buttons/A = `Click 1`
Buttons/B = `Click 0`
Buttons/1 = `1`
Buttons/2 = `5`
Buttons/- = `Click 2`
Buttons/+ = SPACE
IR/Up = (`Cursor Y-`+0.150)
IR/Down = `Cursor Y+`
IR/Left = (`Cursor X-`+0.030)/1.35
IR/Right = `Cursor X+`/1.35
Nunchuk/Buttons/C = LCONTROL
Nunchuk/Buttons/Z = LSHIFT
Nunchuk/Stick/Up = W
Nunchuk/Stick/Down = S
Nunchuk/Stick/Left = A
Nunchuk/Stick/Right = D
D-Pad/Up = UP
D-Pad/Down = DOWN
D-Pad/Left = LEFT
D-Pad/Right = RIGHT

The particular entries that you are going to adjust to fine-tune your aim are IR/Up, IR/Down, IR/Left and IR/Right. Fire up the game (border up!) and aim at the middle of the screen. If your cursor is not exactly lined up with your aim then you'll need to make some minor adjustments. The way this works is if your cursor is let's say slightly off to the right of your aim, then you will need to add to the value of the IR/Left entry. So basically you are pushing the cursor to the left to line up with your aim. If your cursor is say slightly higher than your aim, then you will need to add to the value of the IR/Down entry so you push the cursor down to line up with your aim.

So if your cursor is slightly below your aim then you'll want to increase this line:
IR/Up = (`Cursor Y-`+0.150)
If it's just slightly below your aim maybe try something like +0.165 and see how this looks. Remember, little numbers here make big differences!

You want to get your cursor exactly lined up with your aim when pointing at the middle of the screen before checking alignment as your move towards the outer edges/borders. 

Once you have the cursor perfectly lined up with your aim when pointing at the middle of the screen then you are ready to check the alignment as you move Up, Down, Left and Right all the way to the borders. The way this part works is if the cursor is swinging out further, or drawing back in further as you move your aim towards the border then you need to adjust the multiply (*) or divide (/) values. You will use multiply if the cursor is falling behind your aim and divide if your cursor is pushing out faster than your aim. If for instance your cursor is swing out towards the border as you move your aim out, then you need to increase the divide amount. If the cursor is drawing back in towards the center as you move your aim outwards then you need to increase the multiply amount.

So, if your cursor is swing out to the border faster than your aim when you move towards the Right border you will need to adjust this line:
IR/Right = `Cursor X+`/1.35
Maybe change the line to /1.40 and see what happens.

The goal is to get the cursor directly aligned in the middle of the screen and then make sure the alignment holds as you move Left, Right, Up and Down all the way to each border.

This part is Trial & Error, you have to just keep tweaking until you get it just right. It's very do-able though, I have perfect alignement across the entire screen on all of the games I've adjusted so far.

Once you are happy with the results, save the ini file. If you have applied the adjustment pack then Dolphin will load the ini for each game and make the cursor adjustments for you when playing the game.

Good luck and Happy Shooting!!
