# Dolphin Lightguns Joystick mode Inis (New method)
This release was made by Prof_gLX.
It's based on the Dolphin Lightgun Accuracy work by Prof_gLX, PiperCalls, Ego_bizarro and Tovarichtch.  

I can often be found on the Sinden discord and the Gun4IR discord. I do not provide help in DMs. All DMs asking for help will be ignored.

Collection of inis to get 1:1 (close) aim accuracy with the Sinden Lightgun and Gun4IR in the Dolphin emulator.  

To remove crosshairs from games, get the files from https://github.com/ProfgLX/Dolphin-Lightguns-Accuracy-Inis/ This work is thanks to PiperCalls.  
**USA versions of Wii games are required.**

# Dolphin Accuracy Pack

This pack is mostly for "Rail" type shooters that do not require any character movement in-game. Most of the controls have been designed with the Sinden Lightgun in mind. They will work with Gun4IR as well, but it depends on how many buttons have been installed in the owner's lightgun.

Your Sinden Lightgun must be using joystick mode only available with firmware 1.9 and beta software 2.05.
Your Gun4IR Lightguns must be using joystick mode by switching modes in the Gun4IR GUI or though serial send.
You might have to modify the controller profiles to fit with your lightgun joystick assignments.

The aim/crosshair has been dialed in on all these games.

To install the accuracy inis, follow these steps:
1. Copy the "User" folder from your lightgun option into the main folder of your Dolphin portable install.
2. This might overwrite previously saved settings if you already had "per-game" settings.

You can change button assignements by loading the profiles in the Dolphin controls editor. Do not change anything else.

* Attack of the Movies 3D
* Big Buck Hunter Pro
* Dead Space Extraction (buttons need more assignements for progress)
