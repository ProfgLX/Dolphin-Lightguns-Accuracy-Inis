# Dolphin Lightguns Accuracy Inis (Updated method 2023)
This release was made by by Prof_gLX, PiperCalls, Ego_bizarro and Tovarichtch.  
Collection of inis to get 1:1 (close) aim accuracy with the Sinden Lightgun and Gun4IR in the Dolphin emulator.  
Also included are files to remove crosshairs from games by PiperCalls.  
**USA versions of Wii games are required.**

# Dolphin Accuracy Pack

This pack is mostly for "Rail" type shooters that do not require any character movement in-game. Most of the controls have been designed with the Sinden Lightgun in mind. They will work with Gun4IR as well, but it depends on how many buttons have been installed in the owner's lightgun.

The aim/crosshair has been dialed in on all these games. All aiming is pretty close to perfect and should not have to be adjusted by the user.

To install the accuracy inis, follow these steps:
1. Copy the "Config" folder from "Accuracy and control mappings" into the User folder of your Dolphin portable install.
2. Copy the "GameSettings" from "Accuracy and control mappings" into the User folder of your Dolphin portable install.
3. This might overwrite previously saved settings if you already had "per-game" settings.

You can change button assignements by loading the profiles in the Dolphin controls editor. Do not change anything else.

# Dolphin crosshair removal (By PiperCalls) (crosshairs are for wimps!)

To remove crosshairs from the games:
1. Copy the "Load" folder from "Crosshair removal" into the User folder of your Dolphin portable install.
2. In Dolphin, click on Graphics, click on the Advanced Tab & under the Utility field select Load Custom Textures box.

The Crosshairs are completely removed in most of the games, there are a few games that I haven't been able to track down all the Crosshair textures. Once I get these tracked down I'll include them in future releases. If anyone wants to help track these down, please share.

Here are the games "patches" included with this pack (total of 45 games) along with some notes as needed.
 
* Arcade Shooting Gallery
* Attack of the Movies 3D
* Big Buck Hunter Pro
* Cabela's Monster Buck Hunter
* Chicken Blaster
* Chicken Riot
* Chicken Shoot - this game has issues, you have to use dpad up to move your aim up and even with crosshair on and directly lined up with the target it still doesn't register hits all the time.
* Cocoto Magic Circus
* The Conduit - non Rail type, will def require some more buttons setup, haven't removed the crosshairs yet
* Conduit 2 - non Rail type, will def require some more buttons setup, haven't removed the crosshairs yet
